  <p>4. Preheat a non-stick pan (or griddle) over medium heat.</p>
  <p>5. Spray the pan with cooking spray and scoop ¼ cup sized portions of batter into the pan, leaving room between the scoops of batter.</p>
  <p>6. Cook for 1-2 minutes until bubbles start to form on the top of the pancakes and the edges begin to form (they’ll look slightly raised/curved/dry). Then flip with a spatula to cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</p>
  <p>7. Serve with your favorite toppings and enjoy!</p>

  <p>2.5 lbs potatoes, russet, yellow, or gold potatoes work best, peeled and diced<br>
32 oz chicken stock or broth<br>
1/2 white or yellow onion, sliced<br>
1 cup canned coconut milk, unsweetened<br>
