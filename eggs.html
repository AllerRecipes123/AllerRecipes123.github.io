  <h3>Egg Free Chicken Recipe Recipe:</h3>
  <h4>Ingridients:</h4>
  <img src= "chicken.jpeg" style="width:300px;height:370px;">
  <p>2 teaspoons Kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika<br>
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br>
1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br>
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano<br>
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme<br>
1/4 teaspoon ground sage<br>
olive oil spray<br>
3 pounds whole chicken, humane raised

  <p>2. Spritz the chicken with olive oil and rub the spices all over, evenly.</p>
  <p>3. When ready to cook, transfer the chicken to the air fryer basket.</p>
  <p>4. Place the whole chicken in the air fryer, belly side down and air fry 350F about 25 minutes, until the top of the chicken is browned. Then flip over, and continue cooking about 25 minutes, or until the juices run clear and no longer pink when the thigh is pierced with a pairing knife near the joint, and the internal temperature is 165°F.
